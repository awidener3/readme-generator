This project is a homework assignment from the UCF Coding Bootcamp. In this assignment, I was tasked with creating an application that generates a readme file for future projects that utilizes JavaScript, Node, and the Inquirer package. This readme was created with the application!


## Installation

To install needed packages, run the following command in the project terminal:
```
npm install
```

## Usage

Fork the repo and download to your machine. Go into the terminal for that directory and initiate the application with `npm start`. Answer the questions as you are prompted, and your file will appear in the 'output' folder on your machine.
